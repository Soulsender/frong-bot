# Frong Bot Rust

A multipurpose discord bot originally created for a meme (rewritten in rust).

### Functions
- `/askfrong` can be used to get the bot to use the ChatGPT API to respond in the theme of the god Frong.
- (CURRENTLY BORKED UNTIL I SETUP AN ACTUAL DATABASE) If a user says the word "frong" the bot will reply with "frong" and the attached image below.
    - It will also take note of the user, and add them to `data.csv` to count how many times they say frong in total. This `data.csv` files is mounted via docker volume for persistant storage through updates, and ease of backup ~~(if you REALLY care about backing this shit up, consider taking a shower)~~.
    - You can use `/leaderboard` to see frongs by users, and total frongs said.
    - ~~I put way too much time into this stupid project.~~
- If a user says "I use arch btw" or something of a similar degree, the bot will reply with a random response from a list of responses. These include gifs, images, and phrases.
- `/googlethat` can be used to sarcastically look something up for a user that is too lazy to do it themselves. The bot will reply with a link to [letmegooglethat.com](https://letmegooglethat.com/) with the search query specified.
- `/frong` and `/frongs` can be used to get the bot to respond with different urban-dictionary-esc phrases made by the CosmodiumCS community.

# The frong in question:
Frong (for real, on God) is an expression used in the Cosmodium Cyber Security server for humorous means. It is most commonly utilised in a fashion of agreement about a given subject. Frong (for real, on God) is a derivative of “Fr” (for real) and “ong” (on God). It is not recognized as a legitimate word in the 2022 Oxford English Dictionary but is utilized nonetheless as a cultural reference of mutual agreement. This expression was first coined by Soulsender and CØ$MØ where the two individuals were saying “Fr Fr ong” (for real, for real, on God) as a method of agreement, where after the two expressions were merged to form the new commonly used phrase. Since the debut, the phrase has found use in a server emoji of a small mammal dubbed a “gerbil” with the text “frong” (for real, on God) displayed on the bottom of the image in 2013 type-2 impact font.
